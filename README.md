Some notes:

1. The application has 2 pages
    - **Search** Here you can find the list of pokemons with some information about pokemon's name, type(s), main stats. In the filters area there are 2 filters - by name and by type(s). You may view more detailed information (plus weight and height) any of the pokemon by clicking to the view icon. You may create your own list of favourites pokemons by clicking to the heart icon 
    - **Favourites** Here you can find the list of your favourite pokemons. You can view the detailed information from this page as well
2. The application has a responsive layout. It supports screen resolutions up to 375px (iPhone SE)
3. Components could be reused. So it is easy to:
    - add new similar page with or without filters and result
    - add some new filters to the filters area
    - add some new columns to the result table
    - add some new action to the action column in result table(for example, search manager has view and favourite options, favourite page has view option) 
3. About stack technology. This app was created based on:
    - React library
    - Redux Toolkit, RTK Query
